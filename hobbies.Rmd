##Hiking

I love to go hiking! It allows me to get some exercise, fresh air, and to releive some stress. It's also very humbling indulging in nature. Most often I hit the Parkway or Linville Gorge.

##Snowboarding

I began snowboarding my freshman year when I took the class as one of my P.E. credits. I fell in love with it and got a board for my birthday the next year. Now, I spend a lot of my free-time in the winter with my friends on the slopes! Typically, App. Ski Mtn. or Sugar Mtn.

##Art

I've never really taken any interest in art in the educational setting, mostly because I'm not all that good. However, I love to paint leisurely. I often have blank canvases just waiting to be painted when the inspiration strikes.

##Working Out

Contrary to what this picture depicts, I love going to the gym and using exercise machines! I usually just go for the elliptical and free-weights. It's very stress-releiving, and it really does make for a better day. I can tell when there's extra endorphins flowin'.
